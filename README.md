# BLverse - Life Simulation Game

## 📌 Introduction
**BLverse - Life Simulation Game** is a virtual reality simulation game developed as a graduation thesis project by the BL team (Bình & Long). Inspired by The Sims, the game integrates advanced AI technologies to create NPCs that behave like real humans, experiencing life events such as marriage, cooking, childbirth, careers, healthcare, and entertainment.

## 🚀 Key Features
- **AI-Driven NPCs**: Characters learn, adapt, and interact naturally with their environment.
- **Real-Life Simulation**: NPCs experience realistic daily activities, including relationships, work, and leisure.
- **Dynamic Environment**: The world evolves based on player actions and NPC behaviors.
- **Natural Language Processing (NLP)**: Enables intelligent conversations with NPCs.
- **Deep Learning (DL) & Machine Learning (ML)**: Enhances decision-making and NPC learning capabilities.
- **Computer Vision (CV)**: Recognizes objects and player interactions.
- **Virtual Reality Support**: Immersive gameplay experience.
- **Comprehensive Life System**: Includes hospitals, careers, entertainment zones, and social interactions.

## 🛠️ Technologies Used
- **Game Engine**: Unity (C#)
- **Artificial Intelligence**: Deep Learning, Reinforcement Learning, Decision Trees
- **Natural Language Processing (NLP)**: Transformers, OpenAI API
- **Machine Learning (ML) & Computer Vision (CV)**: TensorFlow, OpenCV
- **Backend**: Python (FastAPI/Flask)
- **Database**: MongoDB/PostgreSQL
- **Docker**: Containerized deployment
